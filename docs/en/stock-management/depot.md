  <p>
    **Attention!** A user must be assigned to a depot before it will be visible
    for them to use.

    To avoid user mistakes and fraud, BHIMA requries that each user be individually
    assigned to a depot similar to [cashboxes]().

Depots are used to store products.  We can not talk about stock without talking about depots. The depot forms
a container for the enterprise's stock, and allows users to import stock through [Stock Entry](), or dispense
stock through [Stock Exit]().

To create a new repository, click on the **Add Depot** button in the top right corner of the module
which will open a modal window to enter the depot information.


## Depot Capabilities
Each depot can be customized to allow only certain kinds of entries and exits.  For example, a central
warehouse might not distribute directly to patients, but may serve as a staging center to distribute to
other depots.  Similarly, a depot could be a distribution center only and not allow direct entry of
donated or purchased stock.
