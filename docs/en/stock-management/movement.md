# Stocks movements

![Inventory and Stocks Management](../../images/stock_movement.svg)

Thanks to BHIMA it is possible to carry out stock movements such as:

- [Stock Entries](./movement.entry.md)
  - From a purchase
  - From an integration
  - From a donation
  - From another depot

- [Stock exits](./movement.exit.md)
  - To a patient
  - To a service
  - To another depot
  - As a stock loss

- [Stock Shipments](.movement.shipments.md): When stock is shipped from one depot to another, we call this a "shipment" and BHIMA has special functions to simplify handling shipments.

- [Stock adjustments](./movement.adjustment.md): When the physical quantities differ from the quantities in BHIMA, it is possible to adjust either positively or negatively the quantity of stocks concerned.

  It should be noted that any movement of stocks (inflows, outflows, adjustments) is recorded in the stock movement registry. This allows you to have the history of stock movements at any time.
