  - From a donation
  - From another depot
- [Stock exits](./movement.exit.md)
  - To a patient
  - To a service
  - To another depot
  - As a stock loss
- [Stock adjustments](./movement.adjustment.md): When the physical quantities differ from the quantities in BHIMA, it is possible to adjust either positively or negatively the quantity of stocks concerned.

  It should be noted that any movement of stocks (inflows, outflows, adjustments) is recorded in the stock
  movement registry. This allows you to have the history of stock movements at any time.
