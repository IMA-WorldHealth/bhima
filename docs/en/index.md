# BHIMA User Manual

Welcome! This manual is for the Basic Hospital Information Management Application \(BHIMA\).  BHIMA is a suite of interrelated tools to help rural hospital administrators in four areas: financial management, stock and inventory management, medical records, and reporting.  It has been a research project of IMA World Health since 2013, and the current code base has been in development since late 2015.

This manual is split into chapters:

1. Getting Started
2. [Finance Modules](./finance/index.md)
3. [Medical Records](./medical-records/index.md)
4. [Inventory and Stock Management](./stock-management/index.md)
5. Reporting and Statistics
6. [Developer Reference](./for-developers/index.md)
