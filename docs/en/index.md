# BHIMA User Manual

Welcome! This manual is for the Basic Hospital Information Management Application \(BHIMA\).  BHIMA is a suite of interrelated tools to help rural hospital administrators in four areas: financial management, stock and inventory management, medical records, and reporting.

4. [Inventory and Stock Management](./stock-management)
