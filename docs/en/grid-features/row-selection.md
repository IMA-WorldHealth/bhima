# Row Selection

Grids that allow you to perform specific actions on a row often require you to select the row first. You will notice grids that support row selection will have a checkbox column as the first column from the left. Clicking on the checkbox column will highlight the row in a soft blue highlight.

Most grids only allow a single element to be selected at a time, and clicking additional rows will simply change the selection to the row clicked. However, a few operations on groups \(such as selecting invoices to pay or lines in a transaction to remove\) allow multiple rows to be selected. In this case, to clear the selection you must uncheck the selected checkboxes.

On grids with multiple row selection, you can select the entire view with the checkbox in the grid's header. The checkbox is a quick way to both select all rows in the view or clear your selection.

Any easy way to deselect all rows you have previously selected is to click on the checkbox in the grid header to select all rows, then deselect all rows. You will no longer have any rows selected.

The trick also works with groups of records, such as transactions. Selecting the group header will select all children, and clicking to select the group header will unselect all the children.
