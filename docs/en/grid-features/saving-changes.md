# Saving Changes to a Grid

Some grids support saving the view a user customized by saving the grid configuration. Once a user has customized the grid in the fashion they desire by manipulating column sizes, visibility and ordering, they can persist the view across session by saving the configuration.

To save the grid configuration, go to **Menu**\(&lt;i class="fa fa-hamburger"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\) &gt;**Save Grid Configuration**. A success message should appear to notify the user that the configuration was saved.

To return to the default configuration, go to **Menu**\(&lt;i class="fa fa-hamburger"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\) &gt;**Clear Grid Configuration**. This will removed the saved grid configuration and restore the default grid configuration.
