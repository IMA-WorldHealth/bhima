<p>Welcome! This manual is for the Basic Hospital Information Management Application (BHIMA).  BHIMA is a suite of interrelated tools to help rural hospital administrators in four areas: financial management, stock and inventory management, medical records, and reporting.  It has been a research project of IMA World Health since 2013, and the current code base has been in development since late 2015.</p>

<p>This manual is split into chapters:</p>
