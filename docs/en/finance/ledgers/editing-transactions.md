## Modifying Transactions

Sometimes a transaction must be modified to reflect changes made to the transaction \(such as during price negotiation\) or to fix typos.  Modifying transactions is performed using the edit feature.

To begin modifying a transaction, you must first [select a row or transaction](/grid-features.md).
