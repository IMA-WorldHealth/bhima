/**
 * POST /invoices
 *
 * The function is responsible for billing a patient and calculating the total
 * due on their invoice.  It will create a record in the `invoice` table.
 *
 * Up to three additional tables may be affected:
 *  1. `invoice_items`
 *  2. `invoice_billing_service`
 *  3. `invoice_subsidy`
 *
 * The invoicing procedure of a patient's total invoice goes like this:
 *  1. First, the total sum of the invoice items are recorded as sent from the
 *  client.  The Patient Invoice module is allowed to edit the item costs as it
 *  sees fit, so we use the POSTed costs.
 *  2. Next, each billing service is added to the invoice by writing records to
 *  the `invoice_billing_service` table.  The cost of each billing service is
 *  determined by multiplying the billing service's value (as a percentage) to
 *  the total invoice cost.
 *  3. Finally, the subsidy for the bill is determined.  NOTE - as of #343, we
 *  are only allowing a single subsidy per invoice.  The array of subsidies is
 *  treated identically to the billing_services, except that it subtracts from
 *  the total bill amount.
 *
 * @todo - change the API to pass in only an array of billingService and subsidy
 * ids.
