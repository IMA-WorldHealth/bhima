/**
 * @overview finance/reports/debtors/index.js
 *
 * @description
 * This report displays the amounts owed by debtor groups broken down by age of
 * their debt.  The report highlights clients who have long overdue debts, so
 * that the administration can send out a recovery service to try and recover
 * the owed debt.
 *
 * The typical age categories are 0-30 days, 30-60 days, 60-90 days, and > 90
 * days.
 *
 * As usual, the reports are created with a handlebars template and shipped to
 * the client as either JSON, HTML, or PDF, depending on the renderer specified
 * in the HTTP query string.
