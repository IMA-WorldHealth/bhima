### Reports Folder

This directory will store generated PDF/HTML reports saved for later by the client.  The saved reports will be accessible via the
reports table in the database.  A cron job is likely needed to clean up this these files periodically.

Note: this functionality is not complete.  Since it is slightly advanced, it is put on hold while we figure Lukunga out.
