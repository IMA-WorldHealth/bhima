OVERVIEW
--------

This procedures file contains all the procedures related to paying cash
payments.  Please be sure to read the SCENARIOS section in detail to understand
the multiple scenarios that can occur and how the application handles them. They
should clarify the "why" questions while the code itself documents "how".

---------
SCENARIOS
---------

For all the following scenarios, please consider a world with two currencies A
and B.  The enterprise supports both currencies A and B. A's minimum monetary
unit is 50, and B's minimum monetary unit is .25.  The enterprise's base
currency is A.  Amounts expressed in "A" will be written 100.00A, and amounts
express in "B" will be written 100.00B.


PREPAYMENTS (SINGLE CURRENCY)
-----------------------------
The application allows for debtors to pre-pay into a cashbox, called a caution
payment.  Often, patients will need to provide some sort of guarantee or down
payment before an expensive operation will be performed.  In this case, the
money goes directly into the cashbox as a credit to the patient's account.

Consider the following scenario:

A debtor would like an expensive operation performed.  To prove the debtor has
the required capital, the enterprise requires a down payment of 500A.  The
debtor goes to the cash window to deposit their 500A.

The following two lines will be written in a transaction:
 1. A 500A debit against the cashbox (putting money into it).
 2. A 500A credit to the debtor (increasing their account w/ the enterprise)


PREPAYMENTS (MULTI-CURRENCY)
----------------------------
Consider the following scenario:

Suppose the exchange rate is 1000A to 1B.

The debtor would like an expensive operation performed.  The enterprise requires
that the debtor pay 10000A as a down payment.  The debtor chooses to pay in
currency B at the cash window.  They will pay (10000A * (1B / 1000A)) = 10B.

The debtor provides 10B as payment.  The application will record the following:
 1. A 10000A debit against the cashbox (representing 10B put into it)
 2. A 10000A credit for the debtor.

In the metadata of the transaction, it is recorded that the debtor actually paid
in B a value of 10B.  However, from the enterprise's perspective, they paid the
equivalent in currency A.

PAYING A SINGLE INVOICE
-----------------------
Consider the following scenario:

A debtor is invoiced for a product 750A, with an exchange rate of 1000A to 1B.
If they choose to pay the invoice that day in currency B, they will be required
to pay 0.75B.

They go to the window to pay in currency B.  They pay 0.75B.  The following
transaction is recorded:
 1. A 750A debit against the cashbox account
 2. A 750 credit against the debtor and their invoice.

As above, the fact they paid with currency B is recorded as metadata.


PAYING A SINGLE INVOICE (WITH LAG)
----------------------------------
Consider the following scenario:

A debtor is invoiced for a product 750A, with an exchange rate of 1000A to 1B.
If they choose to pay the invoice that day in currency B, they will be required
to pay .75B.

However, they instead return on a later date, when the exchange rate has jumped
to 1100A to 1B.  Now, if they choose to pay the invoice on that day, they will
be required to pay (750A * (1B / 1100A)) = 0.68B.  This is not a value they can
produce with a minimum monetary unit of 0.25B.

We can round down to 0.50B (a loss to the enterprise of 0.19B) or round up to
0.75B (a gain to the enterprise of 0.7B).  Since rounding up is the smallest
difference (put another way: the closest to the real price), the system will
round up.

The debtor pays into the system 0.75B, but their invoice was only for 0.68B.
The system will write a single transaction that balances the debtor's invoice
and puts the extra 0.7B in a gain account.  This gain account is defined in the
enterprise table's `gain_account_id`.  The resulting transaction will consist of
three lines:
 1. A debit of 0.75B against the cashbox account.
 2. A credit of 0.68B to the debtor for their invoice.
 3. A credit of 0.7B against the gain account.

NOTE: the values above are expressed in currency B for simplicity.  Since the
enterprise is run in currency A, all those values will be converted into
currency A with the exchange rate on the day it was paid.  In this case, 1100A
to 1B.


PAYING MULTIPLE INVOICES (WITH LAG)
-----------------------------------
The above scenario is a reasonable simple case:  The debtor is paying a single
invoice.  However, the scenario is made more complicated if they choose to pay
multiple invoices.

Suppose that our debtor is paying two invoices, for 750A and 450A.  The exchange
rate is still 1100A to 1B.  We calculate their total debt to be:
(750A + 450A) * (1B/1100A) = 1.09B

Each invoice would be:
750A * (1B/1100A) = 0.681B
450A * (1B/1100A) = 0.409B

Since we can only pay B in increments of 0.25, we can round down to 1B or up to
1.25B.  The application will choose 1B, as it is the closest to the sum of the
two invoices, resulting in a loss of 0.09B (99A) to the enterprise.

It is important to realize that, though the debtor is paying 0.09B less than the
total value of their invoice, they are paying their bill in full.  They should
not have a debt remaining with the enterprise after this transaction. Therefore,
our algorithm will need to produce 0.09B from somewhere to complete the value of
both invoices the debtor is paying.  We take the 0.09B from the enterprise's
loss account, found in the enterprise table, in the column loss_account_id.

The debtor pays 1B, even though the total of their invoices was 1.09B.  The
application will write a single transaction that consists of 4 lines:
 1. A debit of 1B against the cashbox account.
 2. A credit of 0.681B against the first invoice of the debtor
 3. A credit of 0.409B against the second invoice of the debtor
 4. A debit of 0.09B against the loss account.

At the end of this procedure, the debtor will have equalized all their debts,
and the loss account will have made up the difference to ensure that every
invoice was correctly balanced.

CALL PostCash()

DESCRIPTION
This procedure is called after values are already written to the cash table.  It
is responsible for checking if a cash payment is a prepayment (caution) and
writing the transaction lines.  It also contains the algorithm for cycling
through all the invoices, crediting each one the appropriate amount and writing
the remaining balance to the gain or loss account.

DESCRIPTION
Loops through all the cash payments, writing them to disk in the cash_items

CalculateCashInvoiceBalances() procedures should be called before this method to
ensure that the current balances of previous invoices are known.  Only once the

to each invoice.

NOTE
This procedure also blocks a debtor from overpaying an invoice.  An overpayment
is defined as having a value greater than the sum of all invoices they are
attempting to pay, plus the min currency monetary unit.  Put another way, the
difference between the payment amount and the total cost of all invoices should
not be greater than the min monetary unit.
