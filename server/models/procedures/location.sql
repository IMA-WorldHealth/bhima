OVERVIEW
--------

This procedures file contains procedures to ensure data integrity.  It allows an
administrator to merge two locations if they have database access. No clientside
scripts currently access these procedures, but we may write a client interface
in the future.

/*
CALL MergeLocations()

DESCRIPTION
This procedure merges two locations by changing all references to a single uuid.
A "location" is synonymous with a village.uuid.  The first parameter is the
village to remove, and the second is the new village uuid.  A user might want to
do this when there are duplicated locations.
