OVERVIEW
--------

This file contains the logic for safeguarding the general_ledger from invalid
transaction by enforcing a series of checks, known as the Trial Balance.  The
end result is 0 or more errors returned to the client as well as a preview of
how the account balances will change once the data is transferred from the
posting_journal to the general_ledger.

Since much preprocessing is required, several temporary tables are used.  This
allows the data to enter SQL as quickly as possible and leverage INDEXes, JOINs,
and GROUP BYs as quickly as possible.

---------
SCENARIOS
---------

There are several reasons why a transaction might fail a trial balance check.
We will discuss a few of them below:

ADDING TO LOCKED FISCAL YEARS
-----------------------------
Once an accountant has approved of the end of year report, the previous fiscal
year is generally locked and balance accounts are carried forward while income
and expense accounts are zeroed out.  This operation ensures that the general
ledger will remain faithful to the last audit.

However, a user may potentially generate transactions for a previous fiscal
year.  These transactions may not be malicious in intent - some unexpected prior
invoices may need to be added after a year has been locked.  The Trial Balance
will block these invoices from being posted, requiring that the accountant
carefully review why these transactions.  If they are valid, the accountant may
unlock the fiscal year and post them.


LOCKED ACCOUNTS
---------------
An accountant may close down an account in the system for any reason - perhaps
to remove a duplication, perhaps to indicate that a client will no longer be
serviced by the hospital.  This operation can be achieved by locking the account
in the accounts management page.  If there are pending transactions, these will
be blocked from posting until a decision can be made about them.

CALL StageTrialBalanceTransaction()

DESCRIPTION
Copies the transaction into a staging table to be quickly operated on.
*/
CREATE PROCEDURE StageTrialBalanceTransaction(
  IN record_uuid BINARY(16)
)
BEGIN

/*
CALL TrialBalanceErrors()

DESCRIPTION
This stored procedure validates records that are used in the Trial Balance before they are posted
to the General Ledger.  The records are run through a series of SQL queries to validate their
correctness.  The follow assertions are made:
 1. The transaction dates are within the identified period
 2. Every line has some sort of description (best practice)
 3. All affected periods are unlocked.
 4. All affected accounts are unlocked.
 5. All transactions are balanced.
 6. All transactions have at least two lines (required for double-entry accounting)

Please be sure to stage all transactions for use via the StageTrialBalanceTransaction()
call.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Running this query will return NULL if no errors have occurred.  If errors exist in the transaction,
the following table will be emitted.
+--------------------------------------+----------+------------------------------------------------+
| record_uuid                          | trans_id | code                                           |

CALL TrialBalanceSummary()

DESCRIPTION
This stored procedure produces the traditional Trial Balance table showing the account balances for any affected accounts
prior to the balance (`balance_before`), the debits to the accounts (`debit_equiv`), the credits to the accounts
(`credit_equiv`), and the proposed balances at the end of the operation (`balance_final`).  It should be used before
posting to the General Ledger to ensure that all transactions are correctly processed.

To use this method, a Trial Balance must first be _staged_.  The application expects that the record_uuids of all
transactions are already placed in the stage_trial_balance_transaction table via a call to
StageTrialBalanceTransaction().

SAMPLE OUTPUT
