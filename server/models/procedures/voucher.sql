OVERVIEW
--------

This procedures file contains all procedures for creating vouchers.  A "voucher"
is a generic accounting document that can model essentially any transaction.
Given their flexibility, they are expected to be a user's main method of
creating non-standard transactions, such as recording generic payments or
balancing accounts.  All transactions that are not an invoice or cash payment
are modeled as vouchers.

Unlike cash payments and invoices, where many additional calculations may need
to take place prior to writing the transaction, vouchers alone have no
additional preprocessing.  For this reason, they are missing the StageVoucher()
and StageVoucherItem() methods.  The tables can be written to directly from JS.

There is also a special facility for reversing transactions.  In double-entry
accounting, to reverse a transaction, one only needs to flip the debits and
credits of a previous transaction.  However, this does not capture the reason
for which the transaction needed to be reversed.  To overcome this limitation,
BHIMA implements ReverseTransaction(), which adds special text to the previous
transaction's description, as well as points the voucher's "reference_uuid"
column to the reversed transaction.  Despite a similar sounding name, the
"reference_uuid" column is never written to the posting_journal.  It is used
only for reference lookups on the voucher table.

CALL PostVoucher();

DESCRIPTION
This function posts a voucher that has already been written to the vouchers
table.  The route will convert currencies from the given currency into the
enterprise currency directly as it writes the values into the posting_journal.

/*
CALL ReverseTransaction()

DESCRIPTION
A unique procedure specifically for reversing cash payments or invoices.  It
should not be called for vouchers.  The procedures will simply copy the previous
transaction and create a voucher reversing the debits and credits of the
transaction.  In double-entry accounting, this will effectively annul the last
transaction.  Additionally, the voucher will store the uuid of the record that
is being reversed in the "reference_uuid" column of the "voucher" table.  This
enables filters to look up the reversing entry later for any cash payment or
invoice.

Once the procedure has finished, the corresponding cash or invoice record will
have the "reversed" column set to "1".
