OVERVIEW
--------

This section contains all the procedures related to paying cash payments.
Please be sure to read the SCENARIOS section in detail to understand the
multiple scenarios that can occur and how the application handles them. They
should clarify the "why" questions while the code itself documents "how".

---------
SCENARIOS
---------

For all the following scenarios, please consider a world with two currencies A
and B.  The enterprise supports both currencies A and B. A's minimum monetary
unit is 50, and B's minimum monetary unit is .25.  The enterprise's base
currency is A.  Amounts expressed in "A" will be written 100.00A, and amounts
express in "B" will be written 100.00B.


PREPAYMENTS (SINGLE CURRENCY)
-----------------------------
The application allows for debtors to pre-pay into a cashbox, called a caution
payment.  Often, patients will need to provide some sort of guarantee or down
payment before an expensive operation will be performed.  In this case, the
money goes directly into the cashbox as a credit to the patient's account.

Consider the following scenario:

A debtor would like an expensive operation performed.  To prove the debtor has
the required capital, the enterprise requires a down payment of 500A.  The
debtor goes to the cash window to deposit their 500A.

The following two lines will be written in a transaction:
 1. A 500A debit against the cashbox (putting money into it).
 2. A 500A credit to the debtor (increasing their account w/ the enterprise)


PREPAYMENTS (MULTI-CURRENCY)
----------------------------
Consider the following scenario:

Suppose the exchange rate is 1000A to 1B.

The debtor would like an expensive operation performed.  The enterprise requires
that the debtor pay 10000A as a down payment.  The debtor chooses to pay in
currency B at the cash window.  They will pay (10000A * (1B / 1000A)) = 10B.

The debtor provides 10B as payment.  The application will record the following:
 1. A 10000A debit against the cashbox (representing 10B put into it)
 2. A 10000A credit for the debtor.

In the metadata of the transaction, it is recorded that the debtor actually paid
in B a value of 10B.  However, from the enterprise's perspective, they paid the
equivalent in currency A.

PAYING A SINGLE INVOICE
-----------------------
Consider the following scenario:

A debtor is invoiced for a product 750A, with an exchange rate of 1000A to 1B.
If they choose to pay the invoice that day in currency B, they will be required
to pay 0.75B.

They go to the window to pay in currency B.  They pay 0.75B.  The following
transaction is recorded:
 1. A 750A debit against the cashbox account
 2. A 750 credit against the debtor and their invoice.

As above, the fact they paid with currency B is recorded as metadata.


PAYING A SINGLE INVOICE (WITH LAG)
----------------------------------
Consider the following scenario:

A debtor is invoiced for a product 750A, with an exchange rate of 1000A to 1B.
If they choose to pay the invoice that day in currency B, they will be required
to pay .75B.

However, they instead return on a later date, when the exchange rate has jumped
to 1100A to 1B.  Now, if they choose to pay the invoice on that day, they will
be required to pay (750A * (1B / 1100A)) = 0.68B.  This is not a value they can
produce with a minimum monetary unit of 0.25B.

We can round down to 0.50B (a loss to the enterprise of 0.19B) or round up to
0.75B (a gain to the enterprise of 0.7B).  Since rounding up is the smallest
difference (put another way: the closest to the real price), the system will
round up.

The debtor pays into the system 0.75B, but their invoice was only for 0.68B.
The system will write a single transaction that balances the debtor's invoice
and puts the extra 0.7B in a gain account.  This gain account is defined in the
enterprise table's `gain_account_id`.  The resulting transaction will consist of
three lines:
 1. A debit of 0.75B against the cashbox account.
 2. A credit of 0.68B to the debtor for their invoice.
 3. A credit of 0.7B against the gain account.

NOTE: the values above are expressed in currency B for simplicity.  Since the
enterprise is run in currency A, all those values will be converted into
currency A with the exchange rate on the day it was paid.  In this case, 1100A
to 1B.


PAYING MULTIPLE INVOICES (WITH LAG)
-----------------------------------
The above scenario is a reasonable simple case:  The debtor is paying a single
invoice.  However, the scenario is made more complicated if they choose to pay
multiple invoices.

Suppose that our debtor is paying two invoices, for 750A and 450A.  The exchange
rate is still 1100A to 1B.  We calculate their total debt to be:
(750A + 450A) * (1B/1100A) = 1.09B

Each invoice would be:
750A * (1B/1100A) = 0.681B
450A * (1B/1100A) = 0.409B

Since we can only pay B in increments of 0.25, we can round down to 1B or up to
1.25B.  The application will choose 1B, as it is the closest to the sum of the
two invoices, resulting in a loss of 0.09B (99A) to the enterprise.

It is important to realize that, though the debtor is paying 0.09B less than the
total value of their invoice, they are paying their bill in full.  They should
not have a debt remaining with the enterprise after this transaction. Therefore,
our algorithm will need to produce 0.09B from somewhere to complete the value of
both invoices the debtor is paying.  We take the 0.09B from the enterprise's
loss account, found in the enterprise table, in the column loss_account_id.

The debtor pays 1B, even though the total of their invoices was 1.09B.  The
application will write a single transaction that consists of 4 lines:
 1. A debit of 1B against the cashbox account.
 2. A credit of 0.681B against the first invoice of the debtor
 3. A credit of 0.409B against the second invoice of the debtor
 4. A debit of 0.09B against the loss account.

At the end of this procedure, the debtor will have equalized all their debts,
and the loss account will have made up the difference to ensure that every
invoice was correctly balanced.

CALL PostCash()

DESCRIPTION
This procedure is called after values are already written to the cash table.  It
is responsible for checking if a cash payment is a prepayment (caution) and
writing the transaction lines.  It also contains the algorithm for cycling
through all the invoices, crediting each one the appropriate amount and writing
the remaining balance to the gain or loss account.

WriteCashItems()

DESCRIPTION
Loops through all the cash payments, writing them to disk in the cash_items
table.  In order to determine what value to assign each invoice, the
CalculateCashInvoiceBalances() procedures should be called before this method to
ensure that the current balances of previous invoices are known.  Only once the
up to date balances are known can allocation be performed and payments assigned
to each invoice.

NOTE
This procedure also blocks a debtor from overpaying an invoice.  An overpayment
is defined as having a value greater than the sum of all invoices they are
attempting to pay, plus the min currency monetary unit.  Put another way, the
difference between the payment amount and the total cost of all invoices should
not be greater than the min monetary unit.

OVERVIEW
--------

This section contains code for creating and posting invoices made to patients.

NOTE
The rationale behind the Stage* procedures is to interface between JS and SQL.
Every stage method sets up a temporary table that can be used by other
methods.  As temporary tables, they are scoped to the current connection,
meaning that all other methods _must_ be called in the same database
transaction.  Once the connection terminates, the tables are cleaned up.


NOTE
The CopyInvoiceToPostingJournal procedure also handles cost center allocation by the following logic:
  a) If a cost center exists for that account, use the account's cost center.
  b) If no cost center exists for the account, use the cost center of the service selected in the invoice.

This logic applies to invoice_items, invoicing_fees, and subsidies.  As long as each service is assigned a cost center,
every income/expense line in the invoice transaction will have

CALL LinkPrepaymentsToInvoice(invoiceUuid, debtorUuid);

This procedure establishes links between payments that have occurred before
goods or services have been billed.  At invoicing time, the system will check
if the debtor has a creditor balance.  If so, it will attempt to "link" the
prepayments by calling the LinkPrepaymentsToInvoice() method.

The following steps happen:
 1. All unbalanced cash payments before the invoice date are collected, along
with their balances.
 2. For each cash payment, a voucher line is added debiting the debtor and
crediting the invoice.  This line's value is MIN(invoice cost, cash value).
 3. The reference_uuid column is populated with the assigned cash payment's uuid.
 4. The invoice_cost is reduced by MIN(invoice cost, cash value).
 5. If invoice_cost is 0, break.  Otherwise, continue until out of cash payments.

This will either:
 1. Halt after the invoice has been completely allocated to a series of cash
payments.
OR
 2. Halt once all cash payments have been assigned to the invoice. There may or
may not be a remaining balance on the invoice.

DESCRIPTION
This procedure closes a fiscal year in the follow way:
 1. Look up the next fiscal year.  You can only close a fiscal year if you
have a subsequent fiscal year created.
 2. Retrieve the balances for every account by summing the period_totals.
 3. Find the balance of income and expense accounts by summing both groups and
subtracting the total income from the total expense.
 4. Write the balances of every account that isn't an income or expense account
to the period 0 of the subsequent year.
 5. Write the balance of income and expense accounts (step 3) to the period 0
value of the account provided. If this account had a previous value, add the two
to get the final opening balance.

TODO - check that there are no unposted records from previous years.

OVERVIEW
--------

This procedures section contains all procedures for creating vouchers.  A "voucher"
is a generic accounting document that can model essentially any transaction.
Given their flexibility, they are expected to be a user's main method of
creating non-standard transactions, such as recording generic payments or
balancing accounts.  All transactions that are not an invoice or cash payment
are modeled as vouchers.

Unlike cash payments and invoices, where many additional calculations may need
to take place prior to writing the transaction, vouchers alone have no
additional preprocessing.  For this reason, they are missing the StageVoucher()
and StageVoucherItem() methods.  The tables can be written to directly from JS.

There is also a special facility for reversing transactions.  In double-entry
accounting, to reverse a transaction, one only needs to flip the debits and
credits of a previous transaction.  However, this does not capture the reason
for which the transaction needed to be reversed.  To overcome this limitation,
BHIMA implements ReverseTransaction(), which adds special text to the previous
transaction's description, as well as points the voucher's "reference_uuid"
column to the reversed transaction.  Despite a similar sounding name, the
"reference_uuid" column is never written to the posting_journal.  It is used
only for reference lookups on the voucher table.
*/

CALL ReverseTransaction()

DESCRIPTION
A unique procedure specifically for reversing cash payments or invoices.  It
should not be called for vouchers.  The procedures will simply copy the previous
transaction and create a voucher reversing the debits and credits of the
transaction.  In double-entry accounting, this will effectively annul the last
transaction.  Additionally, the voucher will store the uuid of the record that
is being reversed in the "reference_uuid" column of the "voucher" table.  This
enables filters to look up the reversing entry later for any cash payment or
invoice.

Once the procedure has finished, the corresponding cash or invoice record will
have the "reversed" column set to "1".

--------
OVERVIEW
--------

This section contains the logic for safeguarding the general_ledger from invalid
transaction by enforcing a series of checks, known as the Trial Balance.  The
end result is 0 or more errors returned to the client as well as a preview of
how the account balances will change once the data is transferred from the
posting_journal to the general_ledger.

Since much preprocessing is required, several temporary tables are used.  This
allows the data to enter SQL as quickly as possible and leverage INDEXes, JOINs,
and GROUP BYs as quickly as possible.

---------
SCENARIOS
---------

There are several reasons why a transaction might fail a trial balance check.
We will discuss a few of them below:

ADDING TO LOCKED FISCAL YEARS
-----------------------------
Once an accountant has approved of the end of year report, the previous fiscal
year is generally locked and balance accounts are carried forward while income
and expense accounts are zeroed out.  This operation ensures that the general
ledger will remain faithful to the last audit.

However, a user may potentially generate transactions for a previous fiscal
year.  These transactions may not be malicious in intent - some unexpected prior
invoices may need to be added after a year has been locked.  The Trial Balance
will block these invoices from being posted, requiring that the accountant
carefully review why these transactions.  If they are valid, the accountant may
unlock the fiscal year and post them.


LOCKED ACCOUNTS
---------------
An accountant may close down an account in the system for any reason - perhaps
to remove a duplication, perhaps to indicate that a client will no longer be
serviced by the hospital.  This operation can be achieved by locking the account
in the accounts management page.  If there are pending transactions, these will
be blocked from posting until a decision can be made about them.

/*
CALL TrialBalanceErrors()

DESCRIPTION
This stored procedure validates records that are used in the Trial Balance before they are posted
to the General Ledger.  The records are run through a series of SQL queries to validate their
correctness.  The follow assertions are made:
 1. The transaction dates are within the identified period
 2. Every line has some sort of description (best practice)
 3. All affected periods are unlocked.
 4. All affected accounts are unlocked.
 5. All transactions are balanced.
 6. All transactions have at least two lines (required for double-entry accounting)
 7. All transactions with an income/expense account have a cost center.
 8. All liens with a cost center are income/expense accounts

Please be sure to stage all transactions for use via the StageTrialBalanceTransaction()
call.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
Running this query will return NULL if no errors have occurred.  If errors exist in the transaction,
the following table will be emitted.

CALL TrialBalanceSummary()

DESCRIPTION
This stored procedure produces the traditional Trial Balance table showing the account balances for any affected accounts
prior to the balance (`balance_before`), the debits to the accounts (`debit_equiv`), the credits to the accounts
(`credit_equiv`), and the proposed balances at the end of the operation (`balance_final`).  It should be used before
posting to the General Ledger to ensure that all transactions are correctly processed.

To use this method, a Trial Balance must first be _staged_.  The application expects that the record_uuids of all
transactions are already placed in the stage_trial_balance_transaction table via a call to
StageTrialBalanceTransaction().
