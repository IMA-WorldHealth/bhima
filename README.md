BHIMA
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IMA-WorldHealth/bhima.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/IMA-WorldHealth/bhima)

Bhima is a free, open source accounting and hospital information management system
(HIMS) tailored for rural hospitals in Africa.  We are an international team
based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

BHIMA is an acronym for _basic hospital information management application_.

Project Goals
--------------------

BHIMA aims to provide a flexible and robust accounting and managerial solution
for rural hospitals.  This includes, but is not limited to, basic income/expense
reporting, budgeting, patient and organisational billing, depreciation,
inventory and pricing, and purchasing.

Additionally, BHIMA bundles reports and optional reporting plugins to aid
hospital administrators, aid organisations, and governmental/non-governmental
agencies access up to date utilization data.

Finally, the entire project is designed to scale from a single, low cost device
in a clinic, to a large multi-hundred bed institution with tens of users
accessing the server simultaneously.
