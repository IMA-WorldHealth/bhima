_Bhima is alpha version software. Please do not use this in a commerical context._

Bhima is a free, open source accounting and hospital information management system
(HIMS) tailored for rural hospitals in Africa.  We are an international team
based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Project Goals
--------------------

Bhima aims to provide a flexible and robust accounting and managerial solution
for rural hospitals.  This includes, but is not limited to, basic income/expense
reporting, budgeting, patient and organisational billing, depreciation,
inventory and pricing, and purchasing.

Additionally, bhima bundles reports and optional reporting plugins to aid
hospital administrators, aid organisations, and governmental/non-governmental
agencies access up to date utilization data.

Finally, the entire project is designed to scale from a single, low cost device
in a clinic, to a large multi-hundred bed institution with tens of users
accessing the server simultaneously.
